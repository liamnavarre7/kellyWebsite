      <p> I'm sorry you've been so feeling so crappy so what better way to cheer you up than to build a website! It's a little thrown together but 
        I hope you like it. Here's some random photos around camp to hopefully make you feel a little better.

      <p> I'm a big fan of the photo train so I had to sneak one of you guys taking your theme photo. I always thought your 
        overalls looked really cute on you. You rocked this session and it was fun running camp back as a staff with you.

        <p> The sunset the night we went to Colin's was so dope. Of course it was the night that lead to 
            further shenanigans but why not appreciate the sunset before the fireworks amiright? Then we kissed
            for the first time *gasp*. Now it's lead to a summer of fun and excitement.

            <p> I had a lot of fun running trivia with you and finally experiencing the other side of pizza night.
                I hate to admit you wear a bikini better than me but I guess it's a hill I'm willing to die on. 
                We do look incredibly cute though if I do say so myself. Excited to see what future themes and events will bring.

                <p> I know I always mentioning coding but whenever I'm stressed or needing a distraction sometimes I throw myself
                    into it. I wanted to make a little something for you to hopefully serve the same distraction and bring a little light 
                    to this week. You're an incredibly strong and forthright person to be around. I really apreciate these aspects of you. 
                    So here's a website for you! Hope camp isn't too lonely. I'll see you soon. -Liam
